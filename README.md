# compare-RL
Project for ESTR3112: Optimization in Reinforcement Learning

## Objective
We will test Deep Q Learning and Policy Gradients, specifically on the CartPole problem from OpenAI Gym

## Schedule
1. Understand basics of RL: concepts, formulations and problems
2. Understand algorithms for RL in theoretical aspects, including Deep Q Network (DQN), Policy Gradient,...
3. Implement algorithms on simple games (cartpole) and compare their performance
4. Prepare for the presentation and the report
